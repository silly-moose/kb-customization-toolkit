# Knowledge Base Customization Project Setup

Detailed instructions for starting a new KnowledgeOwl knowledge base customization project. For a quick overview of the full workflow, see `00-README.md`.

---

## 1. Create the Project Folder Structure

1. Duplicate the `TEMPLATE-new-project` folder from your local copy of the repo

2. Rename the duplicated folder to the customer's name:
   ```
   Example: Acme, Acme Corp
   ```

3. Inside the customer folder, rename `TEMPLATE-no-changes` to the current date:
   ```
   YYYY.MM.DD-no-changes
   ```
   Example: `2026.01.28-no-changes`

---

## 2. Populate the Backup Folder with Current Code

Open each file in the `YYYY.MM.DD-no-changes` folder and replace the placeholder comment with the current code from the customer's knowledge base.

If a customer has no existing custom code in a given field, leave the placeholder comment as-is. It serves as a record that the field was empty at project start.

| File Name | Source in KnowledgeOwl |
|-----------|------------------------|
| `custom-css.css` | Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > Custom CSS |
| `custom-head.html` | Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > Custom HEAD |
| `custom-html-1-body.html` | Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > Custom HTML > Body |
| `custom-html-2-top-navigation.html` | Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > Custom HTML > Top Navigation |
| `custom-html-3-article.html` | Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > Custom HTML > Article |
| `custom-html-4-article-version.html` | Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > Custom HTML > Article Version |
| `custom-html-5-homepage.html` | Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > Custom HTML > Homepage |
| `custom-html-6-login.html` | Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > Custom HTML > Login |
| `custom-html-7-manage-reader-subs.html` | Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > Custom HTML > Manage Reader Subscriptions |
| `custom-html-8-404-page.html` | Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > Custom HTML > 404 Page |
| `custom-html-9-restricted-access-page.html` | Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > Custom HTML > Restricted Access Page |
| `custom-html-10-right-column.html` | Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > Custom HTML > Right Column |

## 3. Capture the Current State

### Screenshots
Add screenshots of key pages in the customer's current knowledge base to the `Screenshots/` folder inside the no-changes folder:
- Homepage
- A category page
- An article page
- Any other pages relevant to the project

### Full HTML Snapshot (for Claude reference)
1. Open the customer's homepage in Google Chrome
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect**
3. In the Elements panel, right-click on the `<html>` tag at the top
4. Select **Copy > Copy outerHTML**
5. Open `homepage-full-html-snapshot.html` in the no-changes folder
6. Replace the placeholder comment with the copied HTML
7. Repeat for other key pages if needed (create new files like `category-page-full-html-snapshot.html`)

**Why:** This gives Claude visibility into the actual rendered HTML structure, including dynamically generated elements and template output that isn't visible in the Custom HTML fields alone.

---

## 4. Add Reference Documents

Create a `Reference/` folder at the project root (same level as the markdown files) and add:
- Mockups/design screenshots from the customer
- Asana task exports or requirement documents
- Any icons, images, or assets the customer provides

### Optional: Download the Customer's Marketing Site

If the customer has a marketing site, downloading it gives Claude a complete picture of their brand — colors, typography, layout patterns, imagery — so it can suggest KB customizations that match. This is especially useful when the customer hasn't provided a style guide or detailed mockups.

**How to capture a marketing site:**

1. Install the [Save All Resources](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-all-resources/abpdnfjocnmdomablahdcfnoggeeiedb) Chrome extension
2. Open the customer's marketing site in Chrome
3. Open DevTools (F12) and switch to the **ResourcesSaver** tab
4. Click **Save All Resources** — this downloads a `.zip` of the entire page (HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts)
5. Unzip the downloaded file
6. Move the unzipped folder into the `Reference/` folder and name it clearly (e.g., `marketing-site-acme.com`)
7. Add screenshots of key marketing site pages into a `Screenshots/` subfolder within the marketing site folder

**Why this helps:** Claude can read the downloaded HTML/CSS to extract exact brand colors, font stacks, spacing patterns, and layout conventions — then apply them to the KB customization. This produces more accurate results than working from screenshots alone.

**Example folder structure:**
```
Reference/
├── marketing-site-acme.com/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── about.html
│   ├── css/
│   ├── images/
│   └── Screenshots/
│       ├── homepage.png
│       ├── about-page.png
│       └── pricing-page.png
├── mockup-from-customer.png
└── asana-task-export.pdf
```

## 5. Verify Your Folder Structure

Your project should look like this:
```
[your projects folder]/
└── [Customer Name]/
    ├── 00-README.md                            (onboarding intro for new teammates)
    ├── 01-KB_CUSTOMIZATION_PROJECT_SETUP.md   (this file - for reference)
    ├── 02-VERSION_CONTROL_PROCESS.md
    ├── 03-PROJECT_HANDOFF_CHECKLIST.md        (use when completing project)
    ├── CLAUDE.md                               (auto-read by Claude Code — universal process rules)
    ├── .claude/
    │   └── rules/
    │       └── project.md                      (auto-read by Claude Code — customer-specific settings)
    ├── Reference/
    │   ├── knowledgeowl-css-quirks.md   (CSS quirks reference — Claude reads this automatically for CSS/HTML tasks)
    │   ├── (mockups, Asana exports, assets)
    │   └── marketing-site-example.com/  (optional - see section 4)
    │       ├── (downloaded site files)
    │       └── Screenshots/
    └── YYYY.MM.DD-no-changes/
        ├── custom-css.css
        ├── custom-head.html
        ├── custom-html-1-body.html
        ├── custom-html-2-top-navigation.html
        ├── custom-html-3-article.html
        ├── custom-html-4-article-version.html
        ├── custom-html-5-homepage.html
        ├── custom-html-6-login.html
        ├── custom-html-7-manage-reader-subs.html
        ├── custom-html-8-404-page.html
        ├── custom-html-9-restricted-access-page.html
        ├── custom-html-10-right-column.html
        ├── homepage-full-html-snapshot.html
        ├── CHANGES_FROM_no-changes.md
        └── Screenshots/
            └── (current state screenshots)
```

**Optional: Protect the backup folder from accidental edits.** After populating the no-changes folder, you can make its files read-only so they can't be accidentally modified:
```bash
chmod -R a-w YYYY.MM.DD-no-changes/
```
This is not required, but it adds a safety net. If you need to undo it later: `chmod -R u+w YYYY.MM.DD-no-changes/`

---

## 6. Ready to Start

Once setup is complete, open Claude Code in the customer folder — it automatically reads `CLAUDE.md` (universal rules) and `.claude/rules/project.md` (customer-specific settings). Fill in the customer name and KB in `.claude/rules/project.md`, then paste this prompt to kick off the first session:

```
Review the no-changes folder and the reference materials in Reference/. Then let me know when you're ready to start.
```

Claude will review the code, check the deployment target (or ask if it hasn't been set yet), and ask what you want to work on. It will create versioned folders (e.g., `2026.01.28-v1`) as it works.

For guidance on starting subsequent sessions, see "Starting a New Claude Code Session" in `00-README.md`.

## 7. Project Completion

When the project is complete, use `03-PROJECT_HANDOFF_CHECKLIST.md` (included in this folder) to ensure all deployment and documentation steps are completed.
